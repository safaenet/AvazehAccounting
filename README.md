## üìö Usage

I hope you don't mind that the language of the application is in Farsi (Persian)
1. **Login**: Use default credentials set up during the database initialization. If `login` as disabled, you need to `signup` first.
2. **Dashboard**: Access different options of the app here.
3. **Modules**:
   - **Create New Invoice**: Create an invoice.
   - **View Invoices**: View already exsisting invoices.
   - **Create New Ledger**: Create a ledger for customers who continuously buy and pay in once. 
   - **View Ledgers**: View all ledgers.
   - **Bank Checks**: Here we put checks that we paid other people and checks that people paid us. The app notifies us when the due date is close.
   - **Products (Goods)**: List of all the products that are being sold. Products can be created/updated/deleted here.
   - **Customers**: List of all customers. Customers can be created/updated/deleted here.
